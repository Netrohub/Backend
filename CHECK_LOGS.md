# Checking Laravel Logs After Test

## What Happened

When you run `Log::info('Test log message')` in tinker, it returns `null` - that's **normal**! Laravel's logging methods don't return values, they just write to the log.

## Verify the Log Was Written

```bash
# Check if the log file now exists
ls -la storage/logs/

# View the last few lines of the log
tail -n 20 storage/logs/laravel.log

# Or view the entire log
cat storage/logs/laravel.log

# Or follow the log in real-time
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## Expected Output

You should see something like:

```
[2025-01-XX XX:XX:XX] local.INFO: Test log message
```

## If Log File Still Doesn't Exist

1. **Check permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -la storage/
   # Should show drwxrwxr-x for storage/logs
   ```

2. **Check if directory exists**:
   ```bash
   ls -la storage/logs/
   ```

3. **Create it manually**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p storage/logs
   touch storage/logs/laravel.log
   chmod 664 storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

4. **Check Laravel config**:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:show logging.default
   # Should output: stack
   ```

5. **Clear config cache**:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   ```

## Test Again

After creating the file, test again:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
Log::info('Second test message');
exit
```

Then check:
```bash
tail storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## Alternative: Use Render Dashboard

Instead of checking files, use Render's dashboard:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. You'll see all logs there (including from `Log::info()`)

## Check What Log Channel is Active

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
config('logging.default');
// Should output: "stack"
```

## If Nothing Appears

The log might be configured differently. Check:

```bash
php artisan config:show logging.channels
```

This will show all logging channels and their configurations.
